		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<p>Voo Store is located in central Kreuzberg, in a backyard on Oranienstrasse, on a 300 m2 floor on the premises of a former locksmith shop.</p>
		<p>Oranienstraße in central Kreuzberg is known for its spectrum of cultural and creative diversity, which VOO has now widened even further.</p>
		<p>The selection of designers and products play a key role, with an emphasis on design, creativity and good craftsmanship. As for the price level of the merchandise, it’s just as varied as the labels and styles on offer. From streetwear to high fashion, from new brands to renowned designers, Voo offers a constantly rotating selection on collections and design objects, as well as gift ideas and literary classics. In addition you can enjoy truly tasteful coffee from Voo’s in-store Companion Coffee Showroom, serving specialty coffee and tea and limited delicious baked goods.</p>
		<p>Rather than focusing on short-lived trends, Voo will present products that have the potential to become prized possessions for life. Voo is operating as a platform for music, design, fashion and art. The creators of the store are hosting regular exhibits, readings, concerts and showcases of new works from various designers and artists.</p>
